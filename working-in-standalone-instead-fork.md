Woking for a fork will not be displayed in the contribution dashboard
until those commints have been merged into the upstream.
If you don't plan to merge the changes to upstream, you can consider working in a standalong repository instead working for a fork.

Here are the steps:

1. Clone the repository (use git clone) in your terminal.

2. Create a new repository on GitHub webpage (Don't initilize README and LICENSE files, important!).

3. [Change the local repository's remote URL](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/) to point to your new repository.

4. [Push the local repository to your new repository on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).

5. git pull; git push origin master
